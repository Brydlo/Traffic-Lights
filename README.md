# Traffic-Lights
multi-threading, handle exceptions, inherit classes, and implement and apply the circular queue data structure

Do you know how traffic lights were invented? Some time ago, it was decided to replace the traffic police officers with a looped automated system that gives information to drivers about whether they can continue driving or not. In this project, we will implement a simplified version of such a system for a road junction in which many roads converge to one.
